# Basic-Portfolio
Personal portfolio

Bryce HW1 self assessment:

Known issues:
-The about page does not default to occupying the entire browser window vertically. This leaves undesired white space bellow the footer. Would rather the footer go to the bottom of the browser window on the index page but still be positioned relative to the main content on the other longer pages.

-I am not in control of the space between the bottom of the name heading and the top of the content box. It has something to do with what is displayed on top and the height of H1.

-Not sure of the color of the links as I clicked them all so they display purple

-Was unable to find a matching format of the linked in icon. It has rounded corners while stackoverflow and github icons do not.

-The captions on the portfolio page are just that, captions. They should be converted to links at some point.

-Placing the reset.css file above my style.css file makes some but not all of the css changes go away and I'm not sure why.

-On the index page the first paragraph does not line up with the top of the picture
